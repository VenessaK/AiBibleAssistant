# AI Workflow & Agents Project

## Overview

This project is a demonstration of an AI-powered automation system with
both a frontend and backend structure.\
While the `frontend` and `backend` folders exist for project
organization, the main working code is located in: - `src/` --- Core
frontend logic, components, and app setup. - `public/` --- Static
assets. - `workflow/` --- AI n8n workflow configuration and logic. -
`agents/` --- AI agent definitions and supporting scripts. - `context/`
--- Context management files.

**Note:** The `package-lock.json` file is not included in this
repository to avoid unnecessary file size and conflicts. It will be
generated automatically when you install dependencies with
`npm install`.
